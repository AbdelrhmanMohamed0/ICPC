# Problem-Solving Achievement - Al-Azhar ICPC Community

## Overview
I have successfully completed **2 problem-solving sheets** from the Al-Azhar ICPC Community training program (A2IC'21 - Level 1 Training). These sheets are part of my journey to enhance my programming skills and prepare for competitive programming challenges.

## Details
- **Sheets Completed**: Sheet #1 (Finished) and Sheet #2 (Finished).
- **Total Problems Solved**: 51 problems across various topics (25 from Sheet #1 and 26 from Sheet #2).
- **Programming Language**: C++ (specifically GNU G++17 9.2.0).
- **Topics Covered in Sheet #1**:
  - Basic input/output operations (`Say Hello With C++`, `Basic Data Types`, `Simple Calculator`).
  - Conditional statements (`Welcome For You With Conditions`, `Max and Min`).
  - Mathematical computations (`Area of a Circle`, `Digits Summation`, `Summation from 1 to N`).
  - String and character manipulation (`Capital or Small or Digit`, `Char`).
  - Coordinate geometry (`Coordinates of a Point`).
  - Time calculations (`Age in Days`).
  - Sorting and intervals (`Sort Numbers`, `Interval`).
- **Topics Covered in Sheet #2**:
  - Loops and sequences (`1 to N`, `Sequence of Numbers and Sum`, `Easy Fibonacci`).
  - Number theory (`One Prime`, `Primes from 1 to n`, `GCD`, `Divisors`, `Factorial`).
  - Pattern printing (`Pyramid`, `Shape1`, `Shape2`, `Shape3`, `Numbers Histogram`).
  - Conditional logic (`Even Numbers`, `Even, Odd, Positive and Negative`, `Fixed Password`).
  - Mathematical operations (`Max`, `Multiplication Table`, `Sum of Consecutive Odd Numbers`, `Some Sums`).
  - String and digit manipulation (`Palindrome`, `Digits`, `Convert To Decimal 2`).
  - Special sequences (`Lucky Numbers`, `PUM`, `Three Numbers`).

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Proficiency in C++**: Strong understanding of C++ syntax, standard libraries, and efficient coding practices.
- **Problem-Solving**: Ability to analyze problems, design algorithms, and implement solutions under constraints (e.g., 1-3s execution time, 64-256 MB memory).
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Tackled a wide range of problems requiring mathematical logic, number theory, pattern generation, and data manipulation.
- **Debugging and Optimization**: Ensured solutions meet time and memory constraints while maintaining accuracy.
- **Competitive Programming Readiness**: Familiarity with standard input/output formats and problem-solving under pressure.

## Next Steps
I plan to continue solving more sheets, improve my algorithmic efficiency, and participate in upcoming Al-Azhar ICPC contests to further hone my skills.
